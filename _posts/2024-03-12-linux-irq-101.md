# What are interrupt and exception and why do we need them?

Interrupt and exception are mechanisms to handle unusual events that happened in the current workflow. Technically speaking, any event that triggers a divergence in execution and incurs a mode switch could be considered as an interrupt or an exception. More specifically, system calls could be counted as one type of software interrupt. But for the sake of simplicity, we will introduce system calls in a separate chapter. Here in this chapter, we are focusing on hardware interrupt and exception.

The reason for having interrupt is that some events need to be processed in a timely manner. These events include but not limited to incoming of network packets, keyboard input, and inter-process interrupt.

The reason for having exception is that errors happen constantly during runtime.
