# What are interrupt and exception and why do we need them?

Interrupt and exception are mechanisms to handle unusual events that happened in the current workflow. Technically speaking, any event that triggers a divergence in execution and incurs a mode switch could be considered as an interrupt or an exception. More specifically, system calls could be counted as one type of exception. But for the sake of simplicity, we will introduce system calls in a separate chapter. Here in this chapter, we are focusing on more strictly defined interrupt and exception.

The reason for having interrupt is that some events need to be processed in a timely manner. These events include but not limited to incoming of network packets, keyboard input, and inter-process interrupt.

The reason for having exception is that errors happen constantly during runtime.

# How do interrupt and exception work?

Interrupt and exception are often introduced together. Despite that they share a lot in common, we have to clarify the difference between them in the very beginning. I am going to use The Bear — highly recommended, though my anxiety level rockets to the sky every single time I watch it — as an example to elaborate the similarity and difference between these too concepts.

## An example of interrupt

Imagine you are Carmy. The beef is sitting nicely in the pot on the stove and you are preparing for the lunch time. Suddenly some random stupid thing happens out of blue, for example, the water pipe just simply decides to burst. What can you do about it? You are a well trained chef, not a plumber. So you phone up someone who can fix the pipe, and then return to the beef as soon as possible because it is being left unattended. Finally the guy comes and fixes the pipe just before the restaurant opens. Phew! That was close!

## An example of exception

You are still Carmy in this case. The beef is getting ready and the smell is so good right now. Time to prepare the assembling of the sandwiches — but wait! Someone screwed up the number of buns and now you are several dozens short of them. What choice do you have? You have to try your best to make as many buns as possible before the customers flood in. Luckily you are able to bake enough of them just half an hour prior the opening of the restaurant and now it’s time to assemble some delicious sandwiches for all those hungry mouths. Another day another dollar right?
